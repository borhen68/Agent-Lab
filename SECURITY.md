# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is actively supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Please report privately to the maintainers first. Include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Affected files/endpoints
- Optional proof-of-concept

If you do not have a private channel configured yet, set one before public launch
(for example, a dedicated security email or private disclosure form) and update
this file.

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgment: within 72 hours
- Triage decision: within 7 days
- Remediation timeline: based on severity and exploitability
